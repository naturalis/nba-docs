Welcome to the user documentation of the Netherlands Biodiversity Data services - a collection of public services for retrieving biodiversity 
related data from one of the largest natural history collections in the world, present 
at the [Naturalis Biodiversity Center](http://www.naturalis.nl) in Leiden, the Netherlands. 
Our services provides access to more than **8 million** specimen records and counts are steadily growing as our large-scale digitization project proceeds. 

## Resources

### Web services
The Netherlands Biodiversity Data services are comprised of two main service components:

* [The Netherlands Biodiversity API (NBA)](/introduction) is the primary gateway to accessing the digitised Natural History collection at Naturalis.

* [Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL) services](/purl-services) provide permanent, unique and therefore citeable identifiers for all our records.

### Tools
We have developed several tools to ease access to our data:

* The [Bioportal](http://bioportal.naturalis.nl/") is a web application to conveniently browse, query and search our data

* [Client libraries](/introduction/#api-clients) provide programmatic access to the NBA

* The {{%scratchpad-link text="NBA query scratchpad"%}} is an online tool for designing and running complex NBA queries 

### Further documentation

* The {{%swagger-ui-link text="NBA API endpoint reference"%}}{{%/swagger-ui-link%}} site provides detailed information about all 
NBA services and data models

## Version
The current version of the NBA is **{{%nba-release%}}**. The documentation of the previous release (v0) can be
