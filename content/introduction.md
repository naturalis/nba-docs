INTRODUCTION

BACKGROUND
The Netherlands Biodiversity API (NBA) is a public service for retrieving biodiversity related data from one of the largest natural history collections in the world, present in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.The NBA provides access to more than 8 Million specimen records and counts are steadily growing as our large-scale digitization project proceeds. Other than specimen records and metadata, we provide access to taxonomic classification and nomenclature, geographical information, and to multimedia files. By using the powerful Elasticsearch engine, the NBA facilitates searching for collection- and biodiversity data in near real-time. Furthermore, by incorporating information from taxonomic databases, taxonomic name resolution can be accomplished with the NBA. Access is provided via a REST interface and several clients such as the BioPortal (http://bioportal.naturalis.nl/), a web application for browsing biodiversity data that is based on the NBA.
