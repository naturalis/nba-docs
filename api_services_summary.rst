Introduction
========================
The Netherlands Biodiversity API offers web services for free text search and specific indexed field(s) search in multiple taxonomy and specimen occurrence data sources. Searches can be done on either taxa, specimen occurrences, and, multimedia linked to either a taxon or a specimen occurrence. The searchable data is stored as text documents in Elasticsearch document store. In nearly all cases an API request returns data as a JSON-formatted document. 

For each type of data, i.e. taxon, specimen occurrence and multimedia, one or more http GET services - data acquisition operations - are available. Each service is described in this document.
