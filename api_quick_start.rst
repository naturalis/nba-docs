The Netherlands Biodiversity API, a.k.a. NBA, is a public API which can be accessed directly. It is primarly intended for computers to communicate with other computers.

The base url for each service is: 

.. code:: html

  http://api.biodiversitydata.nl/v0
  
For more information about the API version you are working with click here_. 

The Netherlands Biodiversity API endpoints follow the general form:

.. code:: html

  http://api.biodiversitydata.nl/{api_version}{endpoint}{optional parameters}

In nearly all cases an API request returns data as a JSON-formatted document. 


For Quick start purposes you can consult per service a set of examples which can be accessed through the example links in the `services summary`_ . 

Information on requests, searchable fields and responses can also be accessed via the services summary. 

Naturalis has created the Bioportal for sharing it's collection data with experts and the general public. The bioportal uses NBA search services for collection data acquisition. Just have a look at the `Bioportal`_ to get an idea of the NBA services' possibilities and the available biodiversity data.
