Introduction
============
Naturalis offers web services for free text and indexed field search in multiple taxonomy and specimen occurrence data sources. Searches can be done on either taxons, specimen occurrences and multimedia linked to either a taxon or a specimen occurrence. The searchable data is stored text documents in Elastic search document store. 

Per service type the following information is available.

1.TAXON SEARCH
--------------
 
*Description*
 Free text or indexed field search through taxonomic data from two data sources, i.e. 1. Nederlands Soortenregister, and 2. Catalogue of Life. It searches a specific predefined set of indexed taxon document fields and returns taxonomic data from basically species and subspecies. All searchable fields in taxon documents are listed here (refer to fields information per service document). 

 Base url: http://10.42.1.177:8080/v0

.. _requests:

*Requests*
  *url*
   The basic request url for free text search is:
   <base url>/taxon/search/?_search=[term], e.g. http://10.42.1.177:8080/v0/taxon/search/?_search=Abies
  
   The basic request url for indexed field search is:
   <base url>/taxon/search/?indexedField1=[term]&indexedField2[term], e.g. http://10.42.1.177:8080/v0/taxon/search/?genusOrMonomial=Parus
  
  *indexed field parameters*
   A taxon document incorporates an extensive set of taxonomic fields. A subset of these set are searchable fields. These fields are listed here_.
   .._fields: http://www.naturalis.nl/

   - document field name
   - aliases and multi mapped fields
   - whole path
   
  *general meta parameters*
   For both free text and indexed field search requests optional extra request parameters – so called meta parameters - can be added. These parameters instruct the NBA on how to execute a query.

   <base url>/specimen/search/?_search=[term], e.g. <base url>/specimen/search/?_search=Parus
      
   The basic request url for indexed field search is:
   <base url>/specimen/search/?indexedField1=[term]&indexedField2=[term], e.g. <base url>/specimen/search/?typeStatus=holotype or <base url>/specimen/search/?typeStatus=holotype&sex=male 
     
  *geospatial search option*
   Geospatial search 
 
   Geospatial search can be combined with either free text or indexed field search. It can also be used on its own.
 
  *additional integrated search option*
   
   Name resolution is
   Class resolution is
   Scientific name mapping is
    
  *indexed field parameters*
   For indexed field search indexed field parameters
  
   - document field name
   - aliases and multi mapped fields
   - whole path
    
  *general meta parameters*
   For both free text and indexed field search requests optional extra request parameters – so called meta parameters - can be added. These parameters instruct the NBA on how to execute a query.

2.SPECIMEN-NAME SEARCH
----------------------

*Description*
 Free text or indexed field search through specimen occurrence data from multiple data sources. It searches a predefined set of  specimen object fields and returns taxonomic, geospatial and temporal information from specimen.
   
*Requests*
  *url*
   The basic request url for free text search is:
   <base url>/specimen/name-search/?_search=[term], e.g. <base url>/specimen/name-search/?_search=Parus&

   The basic request url for indexed field search is:
   <base url>/specimen/name-search/?indexedField1=[term]&indexedField2, e.g. <base url>/specimen/name-search/?typeStatus=holotype or typeStatus=holotype&sex=male

  *geospatial search*
   Geospatial search is…

   Geospatial search can be combined with either free text or indexed field search. It can also be used on its own. 
   
  *additional integrated search capabilities*
   Name resolution is 
   Class resolution is
   Scientific name mapping is

  *general meta parameters*
   For both free text and indexed field search requests optional extra request parameters – so called meta parameters - can be added. These parameters instruct the NBA on how to execute a query.

   Paging parameters

   ===========   =========================================================================================================
   Name          Description
   ===========   =========================================================================================================
   _maxResults   - _maxResults instructs NBA to return maximum amount of search results per page

                 - default setting: _maxResults=10
   _offset       - _offset instructs NBA to start filling first response from search result no = offset value + 1
                 - example: <base url>/specimen/name-search/?..&_offset=100. In first response search result no 101 is first document in response 
                 - default setting: _offset=0

   _sort            - _sort instructs NBA to return responses sorted on a single specified indexed field included in Specimen documents.
                    - example: <base url>/specimen/name-search/?..&_sort=indexedFieldName, e.g. …&_sort=genusOrMonomial. 
                    - default setting: _sort = _score
                   	- remarks: _sort parameter can be used on these sortable fields
   _sortDirection   - _sortDirection instructs NBA on sorting direction, i.e. either descending or ascending
                    - example: <base url>/specimen/name-search/?..&_sortDirection=ASC or &_sortDirection=DESC 
                    - default setting: _sortDirection=ASC

1.MULTIMEDIA SEARCH
--------------
 
*Description*
 Free text or indexed field search through specimen occurrence ánd taxonomic data from multiple data sources. It searches a specific predefined set of multimedia fields and returns taxonomic, geospatial and temporal information from multimedia and …for taxons.

*Requests*
  *url*
   The basic request url for free text search is:
   <base url>/multimedia/search/?_search=[term], e.g. <base url>/taxon/search/?_search=Abies
  
   The basic request url for indexed field search is:
   <base url>/multimedia/search/?indexedField1=[term]&indexedField2[term], e.g. <base url>/taxon/search/?genusOrMonomial=Parus or genusOrMonomial=Parus&species=major
  
  *indexed field parameters*
   For indexed field search indexed field parameters
  
   - document field name
   - aliases and multi mapped fields
   - whole path
   
  *general meta parameters*
   For both free text and indexed field search requests optional extra request parameters – so called meta parameters - can be added. These parameters instruct the NBA on how to execute a query.

                    - default setting: _sort = _score
                   	- remarks: _sort parameter can be used on these sortable fields
